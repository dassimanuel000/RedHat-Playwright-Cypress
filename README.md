# ✅ Quality Assurance Automation on RedHat – Playwright, Cypress & Puppet

This document explains, in simple terms, the behavior and processes typically found on a **RedHat Linux server** used in a corporate QA (Quality Assurance) environment — particularly when leveraging tools like **Playwright**, **Cypress**, and **Puppet**.

---

## 🧭 Overview

In enterprise environments, testing and configuration automation play a critical role in ensuring stability, reproducibility, and speed of delivery. Here's how various tools and behaviors come into play on RedHat Linux servers used for QA automation.

## 🧱 Server Behavior on RedHat Linux

RedHat servers in QA environments often follow structured and predictable patterns:

- 📦 **Packages** are installed via `dnf` or `yum`, often mirrored through internal repositories.
- 🧹 System services are maintained using **systemd** units.
- 🔒 Strict permission rules and **SELinux** policies are often enforced.
- 📂 Logs and monitoring data are sent to centralized systems (like ELK, Splunk).
- 🛠️ Environments are configured consistently with automation tools like **Puppet**.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Management with Puppet

**Puppet** ensures that all RedHat servers used for QA:

- Are kept in a consistent state
- Have the same browser versions, binaries, dependencies
- Automatically install or update tools like Cypress or Playwright if missing

This eliminates "it works on my machine" scenarios and improves test reliability.

## 🧪 Automation with Cypress and Playwright

Both **Cypress** and **Playwright** are used to automate browser actions for end-to-end testing. They simulate real user behavior — like clicking buttons, filling forms, and checking responses.

### 📌 Key Differences

| Tool      | Typical Use Case                        | Strengths                         |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Cypress   | Front-end testing with strong UI support | Simple setup, interactive debugging |
| Playwright | Cross-browser & parallel testing        | Handles multiple browsers and contexts natively |

## 🦊 Firefox Binary: System vs. Automation

One important detail when testing browsers is the **version and source** of the browser binary — especially with **Firefox**.

### 🔍 System Firefox (RedHat)

- Installed via `dnf install firefox`
- Meant for general desktop use
- Follows RedHat's update and patch cycle
- Includes system-specific patches and configurations
- May **not** be compatible with automation tools without additional flags

### 🤖 Playwright Firefox

- A **custom build** of Firefox maintained by the Playwright team
- Pre-configured for automation use
- Stripped of unnecessary UI components
- More predictable behavior during testing
- Ensures compatibility across OS, CI/CD environments

**Why it matters**:  
Automated tests using the system Firefox might behave differently or fail unexpectedly. Using the Playwright-provided Firefox ensures consistency across environments and test runs.

---

## 🧩 Summary

On RedHat QA servers, the following patterns emerge:

- Configuration is enforced with Puppet
- UI tests are run with Cypress and Playwright
- System browsers differ from automation browsers — and that matters
- Automation reliability depends on **consistent binaries, clean environments**, and **controlled updates**
